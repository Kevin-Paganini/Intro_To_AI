DUNGEON:
Represents a dungeon as a collection of (possibly connected) rooms.  Each
room in the dungeon is unique. A room can be connected to rooms that are
not registered with the dungeon by calling add_room; this just means there
is no way to look up the room, but it will still be possible to travel
such a room.  Likewise, client code can start with other rooms besides the
specified start room.

Attributes:
    start (Room): recommended start location when exploring the dungeon.


ROOM:

def neighbors --> returns list of neighbors accesible from self

every room has a name and 


Goal: a room

on current node call neighbors, add to data structure, than pop off and go to next
